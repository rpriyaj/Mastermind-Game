## Task    
Design and build an electronic arcade game using a 16-bit ALU, using Alchitry Au FPGA 

## Mastermind with a twist (1-Player) 
Mastermind is a challenging memory game that revolves around the exciting concept of code-breaking. The game features a predetermined sequence of colors, which players must decode through strategic guessing and deduction with a twist. An imposter lurks within the game! The objective is to correctly guess the hidden color code with a maximum of 8 attempts allowed. 
Players can see two sets of LED lights, one used for storing the playerâ€™s guess and the second half showing the hints of the guess for each attempt. 

The computer will output hints based on each guess. Red and white hints will be given with the following conditions:
- Red hints: Both colour and position of guess is correct 
- White hint: Correct colour, wrong position 

The objective of the game is for the player to guess all 4 colours correct and achieve 4 red hints with 8 tries. 


## Hardware Requirement 
The game was built with Alchitry Au FPGA, WS2812B LED strips and buttons.
