2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-9#1 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at auto/rom_answers/answers3__1 of size 6x6, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at auto/rom_answers/answers3__2 of size 6x6, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#3 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at auto/rom_answers/answers3__3 of size 6x6, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance auto/alu16/mult/out0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -33.741 ns between auto/M_test_states_q_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_0) and auto/M_test_states_q_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -33.862 ns between auto/M_test_states_q_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_0) and auto/M_test_states_q_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -33.942 ns between auto/M_test_states_q_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_0) and auto/M_test_states_q_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
